## Usage

### Automated setup
Run the install script either via: 
```
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kushagharahi/.dotfiles/master/install.sh)"
```
(GitHub will cache this script, if you are actively developing/pushing, add `?token=$(date +%s)` to the end of the url to get around this)
or by cloning this repo to `$HOME/.dotfiles` and running `Ã¬nstall.sh` (safer)

    - Update plugins to be `git zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting`
